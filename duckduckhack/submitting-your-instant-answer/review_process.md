## Review Process

When you submit a pull request, a community leader will assign themselves to your pull request and work with you to get your Instant Answer live on DuckDuckGo. All comments and suggestions for your pull request should be discussed publicly in the pull request on Github, so that others can follow the progression. Of course, you can always contact anyone from the community or team if you have questions. Here are some community leaders who are available to help out:

   - The community leader will ping [@abeyang](https://github.com/abeyang) (or [@chrismorast](https://github.com/chrismorast)) for any design/interaction feedback.
   - The community leader will test and give feedback about your code.
   - You discuss and incorporate any applicable feedback.
2. When the community leader feels that the Instant Answer is ready to go live, they ping [@jagtalon](https://github.com/jagtalon) so that he can set it up on a testing server.
3. Final review by the internal team.
4. Your pull request gets merged in and goes live!
