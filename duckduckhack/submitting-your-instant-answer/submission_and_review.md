## Making a Pull Request

Now that you have completed the [developer checklist](https://dukgo.com/duckduckhack/developer_checklist) and added [Metadata](https://dukgo.com/duckduckhack/metadata) to your Instant Answer, you are ready to submit a pull request.

<!-- /summary -->

If you are not sure how to create a pull request, GitHub provides excellent [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

The root of each repository contains a `pull_request_template` which includes the most common questions the team will have about your contribution. The contents of this file should be copied and pasted directly into the [description area](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/pull_requests/pullrequest-description.png) of the GitHub pull request form. The completed template will help the community better understand your pull request and expedite the review process.


## Review Process

When you submit a pull request, a community leader will assign themselves to your pull request and work with you to get your Instant Answer live on DuckDuckGo. All comments and suggestions for your pull request should be discussed publicly in the pull request on Github, so that others can follow the progression. Of course, you can always contact anyone from the community or team if you have questions. Here are some community leaders who are available to help out:

- [@bradcater](https://github.com/bradcater)
- [@kablamo](https://github.com/kablamo)
- [@loganom](https://github.com/loganom)
- [@mattr555](https://github.com/mattr555)
- [@mintsoft](https://github.com/mintsoft)

- [@killerfish](https://github.com/killerfish)
- [@MrChrisW](https://github.com/mrchrisw)
- [@javathunderman](https://github.com/javathunderman)

Here's how the whole process looks, after you submit your pull request:

1. A community leader (an experienced member of the community) will work with you on your pull request.
   - The community leader will ping [@abeyang](https://github.com/abeyang) (or [@chrismorast](https://github.com/chrismorast)) for any design/interaction feedback.
   - The community leader will test and give feedback about your code.
   - You discuss and incorporate any applicable feedback.
2. When the community leader feels that the Instant Answer is ready to go live, they ping [@jagtalon](https://github.com/jagtalon) so that he can set it up on a testing server.
3. Final review by the internal team.
4. Your pull request gets merged in and goes live!
