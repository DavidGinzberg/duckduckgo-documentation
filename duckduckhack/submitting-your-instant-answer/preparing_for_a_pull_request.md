## Preparing for Pull Request

By now you should have:

- Determined your Instant Answer type
- Forked the correct repository
- Written and committed the code for your Instant Answer
- Written a comprehensive test for your Instant Answer
- Verified that everything works and nothing is broken
- Confirmed the Instant Answer adheres to the [design guidelines](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/styleguide_overview)

At this point you are ready to add metadata to your Instant Answer which will help us to understand it a little better.

**Note**: If your pull request is an update to an ***existing*** Instant Answer, don't forget to add yourself to the attribution too!
