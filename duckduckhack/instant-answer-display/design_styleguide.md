# Instant Answer Design Style Guide

Being an open-source project with many contributors from all over the world, we strive for all our Instant Answers to appear aesthetically consistent. 

This means we maintain certain visual aspects across all of our Instant Answers such as the fonts and colors used, as well as the layout and placement of common elements. This helps instill a feeling of familiarity in our users when they come across new Instant Answers and improves usability and comfort with the interface.

The most current design guide for all of DuckDuckGo, including Instant Answers, can be found at the [Official DuckDuckGo Style Guide](https://duckduckgo.com/styleguide).

This section explains how the style guide affects the creation of a new Instant Answer.
